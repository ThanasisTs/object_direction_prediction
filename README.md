# Object direction prediction

## Description
Let us assume that there are 5 objects on a table and a human approaches one of them. The goal of this project is the prediction of the object that a human tries to approach. Human monitoring is achieved using a RGB-D camera. The objects are placed in known locations and therefore no object detection and object localization algorithms are used.
